# Graphs

A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

## Challenge

Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

* add node
* add edge
* get nodes
* get neighbors
* size

## Approach & Efficiency

* add node
  * Time Big O **O(1)**
  * Space Big O **O(N)**
* add edge
  * Time Big O **O(1)**
  * Space Big O **O(N)**
* get nodes
  * Time Big O **O(N)**
  * Space Big O **O(N)**
* get neighbors
  * Time Big O **O(1)**
  * Space Big O **O(1)**
* size
  * Time Big O **O(1)**
  * Space Big O **O(1)**

## API

* add node: Add a node to the graph
* add edge: Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
* get nodes: Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection
* get neighbors: Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
* size: Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
