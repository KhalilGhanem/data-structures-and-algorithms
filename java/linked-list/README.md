# Singly Linked List
A data structure that contains nodes that links to the next node in the list.

## Challenge
Create a Node class, Create a Linked List class which contain the following methods (insert, includes, to string)

## Approach & Efficiency

* Insert
    * Time Big O **O(1)**
    * Space Big O **O(1)**
* includes
    * Time Big O **O(n)**
    * Space Big O **O(1)**  
* toString 
    * Time Big O **O(n)**
    * Space Big O **O(1)**
* Append    
    * Time Big O **O(n)**
    * Space Big O **O(1)**
* InsertBefore  
    * Time Big O **O(n)**
    * Space Big O **O(1)**
* InsertAfter  
    * Time Big O **O(n)**
    * Space Big O **O(1)**    
## API

* insert: Adding a new node to the Linked List
* includes: Check if the Linked List contain a certain value.
* toString: Return all the values in the Linked List.

### Challenge 06:

* Append: Adding a new node to the end of the Linked List.
* InsertBefore: Adding a new node before the target node in the the Linked List.
* InsertAfter: Adding a new node after the target node in the the Linked List.
